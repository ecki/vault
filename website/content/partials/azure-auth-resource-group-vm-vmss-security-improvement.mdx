On versions of Vault prior to 1.19.2, 1.18.8, 1.17.15, and 1.16.19, when login was attempted with Azure auth,
`resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` parameters were not strictly validated against the token claims.
These parameters are now validated against the token claims.
The token claims are required to have "xms_mirid" or/and "xms_az_rid" claims depending on the
identities that are attached to the standalone or Virtual Machine Scale Set stemmed virtual machine
which generates the MSI token.

If system assigned managed identity is enabled and no identity is specified in the Instance
Metadata Service request, "xms_mirid" claim will be in the format of
"/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{virtual-machine-name}"
, and "xms_az_rid" claim doesn't exist.

If system assigned managed identity is not enabled, and only one user-assigned identity exists,
"xms_mirid" claim will be in the format of
/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{user-assigned-managed-identity}
"xms_az_rid" claim will be in the format of
"/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{virtual-machine-name}"

If system assigned managed identity is not enabled, and multiple user-assigned identities exist,
users are required to specify a managed identity in the Instance Metadata Service request.
See [Azure managed identity REST endpoint reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?tabs=portal%2Chttp#rest-endpoint-reference)
for more details on how to specify the identity in the request.
In this case, "xms_mirid" claim will be in the format of
/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{user-assigned-managed-identity},
"xms_az_rid" claim will be in the format of
"/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{virtual-machine-name}".

See [Managed identities for Azure resources frequently asked questions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identities-faq#what-identity-will-imds-default-to-if-i-dont-specify-the-identity-in-the-request)
for more details on what identity Azure Instance Metadata Service defaults to if no identity is specified in the request.

{resource-group-name} in those claims must match `resource_group_name`. If `vm_name` is provided, {virtual-machine-name}
must match. If `vmss_name` is provided, {virtual-machine-name} must be in the format of {vmss-name}_{instance-id}.
If any requirement is not met, the login will fail.
