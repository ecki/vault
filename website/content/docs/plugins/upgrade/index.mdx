# Upgrade plugins

As mentioned earlier, disabling existing mounts will wipe the existing data.

Overwriting an existing version in the catalog will affect all uses of that
plugin version. So if you have 5 different Azure Secrets mounts using v1.0.0,
they'll all start using the new binary if you overwrite it. We recommend
treating plugin versions in the catalog as immutable, much like version control
tags.

Each plugin has its own data within Vault storage. While it is rare for HashiCorp
maintained plugins to update their storage schema, it is up to plugin authors
to manage schema upgrades and downgrades. Check the plugin release notes for
any unsupported upgrade or downgrade transitions, especially before moving to
a new major version or downgrading.

Existing Vault [leases](/vault/docs/concepts/lease) and [tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens)
are generally unaffected by plugin upgrades and reloads. This is because the lifecycle
of leases and tokens is handled by core systems within Vault. The plugin itself only
handles renewal and revocation of them when itâ€™s requested by those core systems.
