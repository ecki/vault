# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are discrete pieces of
information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication certificates,
sensitive data, and any other critical piece of information you need to keep
private and secure.

HashiCorp Vault can help harden your applications by centralizing secret
management, rotating old credentials, generating credentials on demand, auditing
all interactions, and supporting regulatory compliance.

- [**Manage certificates**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/certificates) - 
  Configure Vault to work with certificate authorities like KMIP and PKI to
  manage certificate life cycles and authenticate clients.
