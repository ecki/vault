# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are discrete pieces of
information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication certificates,
sensitive data, and any other critical piece of information you need to keep
private and secure.

HashiCorp Vault can help harden your applications by centralizing secret
management, rotating old credentials, generating credentials on demand, auditing
all interactions, and supporting regulatory compliance.

- [**Manage static secrets**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/static-secrets) - 
  Store and rotate arbitrary secrets in Vault with the Key/Value and Cubbyhole
  plugins. Vault encrypts data before writing out to persistent storage, so
  accessing the raw storage is insufficient to access the information.

- [**Manage certificates**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/certificates) - 
  Configure Vault to work with certificate authorities like KMIP and PKI to
  manage certificate life cycles and authenticate clients.

- [**Manage identities and authentication**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/identities) - 
  Control client access to sensitive information with managed entities, identity
  tokens, OIDC workflows, and workload identity federation (WIF).

- [**Manage 3rd-party secrets**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/3rd-party-secrets) - 
  Integrate Vault with the other elements of your development environment to
  generate and revoke on-demand credentials for database systems and cloud
  providers like AWS or control access to external encryption keys and cloud
  credentials.

- [**Manage sensitive data**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/sensitive-data) - 
  Define custom parameters to encrypt or tokenize sensitive data in transit and at
  rest without storing the data in Vault.

- [**Support regulatory compliance**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/regulatory-compliance) - 
  Configure Vault as part of an HSM solution, FIPS compliant architecture, or
  PKCS11 authN workflow.
