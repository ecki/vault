# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are discrete pieces of
information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication certificates,
sensitive data, and any other critical piece of information you need to keep
private and secure.

HashiCorp Vault can help harden your applications by centralizing secret
management, rotating old credentials, generating credentials on demand, auditing
all interactions, and supporting regulatory compliance.

- [**Manage 3rd-party secrets**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/3rd-party-secrets) - 
  Integrate Vault with the other elements of your development environment to
  generate and revoke on-demand credentials for database systems and cloud
  providers like AWS or control access to external encryption keys and cloud
  credentials.
