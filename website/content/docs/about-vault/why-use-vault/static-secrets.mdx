# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are discrete pieces of
information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication certificates,
sensitive data, and any other critical piece of information you need to keep
private and secure.

HashiCorp Vault can help harden your applications by centralizing secret
management, rotating old credentials, generating credentials on demand, auditing
all interactions, and supporting regulatory compliance.

- [**Manage static secrets**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/static-secrets) - 
  Store and rotate arbitrary secrets in Vault with the Key/Value and Cubbyhole
  plugins. Vault encrypts data before writing out to persistent storage, so
  accessing the raw storage is insufficient to access the information.
