# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are discrete pieces of
information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication certificates,
sensitive data, and any other critical piece of information you need to keep
private and secure.

HashiCorp Vault can help harden your applications by centralizing secret
management, rotating old credentials, generating credentials on demand, auditing
all interactions, and supporting regulatory compliance.

- [**Manage sensitive data**](/vault/docs/about-vault/why-use-vault/sensitive-data) - 
  Define custom parameters to encrypt or tokenize sensitive data in transit and at
  rest without storing the data in Vault.
